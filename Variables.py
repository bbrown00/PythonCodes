#A variable is a value that can change. 
#They can be used to store information that can be referenced and used by programs. 
#Instead of using the stored value directly, we can use the variable instead.
#Variables could be any number of things, such as, a string of text, a list or an object. 
#Using variables makes our code flexible and reusable. Without variables we would have to hard code all our values into the code.
